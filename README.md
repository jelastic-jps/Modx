# MODX

The package deploys the [MODX](https://modx.com/) CMS solution - an open-source, powerful, and flexible content management system (CMS) that helps users build and maintain websites. It offers a high degree of customization and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of web projects, from simple blogs to complex web applications.


## Environment Topology

This package creates a dedicated MODX environment that contains one application server and one database container. It automatically deploys and sets the MODX application. The automatic vertical scaling is enabled out of the box, and [horizontal scaling](https://www.virtuozzo.com/application-platform-docs/automatic-horizontal-scaling/) can be configured (if needed). The default software stacks utilized in the package are the following:

- Apache 2 PHP application server (PHP 8.2)
- MySQL 8 database
- MODX 3.0.3
